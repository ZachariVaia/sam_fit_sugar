# sam_fit_sugar
"sam_fit_sugar" is a system that processes images to generate 3D meshes without backgrounds. By combining SAM (Surface-Aligned Mesh) and SUGAR (Surface-Aligned Gaussian Splatting), it aligns surfaces and creates efficient 3D models, perfect for applications requiring clean, background-free reconstructions.
